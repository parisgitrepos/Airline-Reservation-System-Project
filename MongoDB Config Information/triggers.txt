You can only book up to six days in advance. This means that when you book on, for example, Friday, you can only book
up to Thursday. This is important because the tickets do not show dates, rather days. However, the system must refresh
to invalidate the reservation when the day has passed. When you book for a Thursday flight, on Friday the system
automatically goes back in and voids the reservation (adds "PAST" to day).

Another example - if you had booked on Friday for a Saturday flight, your ticket would automatically be invalidated on
Sunday.

This is achieved by using MongoDB Triggers, written in "Mongoose" and stored in MongoDB's system. Triggers can be scheduled
to activate based off a day in the week. Below is the code for each Trigger and associated info.


TRIGGER INFO - SET TO EXECUTE EVERY WEDNESDAY
exports = function() {
    const collection = context.services.get("My-Cluster").db("Airline-Reservation-System").collection("reservations");
    collection.updateMany({"day": "Tuesday"}, {$set: {"day": "Tuesday (PAST)"}});
}

TRIGGER INFO - SET TO EXECUTE EVERY THURSDAY
exports = function() {
    const collection = context.services.get("My-Cluster").db("Airline-Reservation-System").collection("reservations");
    collection.updateMany({"day": "Wednesday"}, {$set: {"day": "Wednesday (PAST)"}});
}
